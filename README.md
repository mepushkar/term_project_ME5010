# term_project_ME5010
file profect_fractal.ipynb contains the code 
.pdf file is the report and rest are the compiled images of Newton fractals
generated from the python code

pls enter the list of the coefficients of the polynomial so that np.roots is able 
to generate the actual roots of the given polynomial

for polynomials of degree higher than the number of colors in the code 
pls add extra colors.......


and ENJOY......!!!!!!!!!!!!
